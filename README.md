# Flag of Nepal


As the only national flag in the world that is not rectangular or square in shape, Nepal's flag stands out as a unique national symbol. However, finding high-quality images of the flag online can be a challenge, especially ones that accurately reflect its original size and dimensions. This became apparent to me when I was working on some Android apps that required the use of Nepal's flag, but the images I found on the internet were either poor in quality or the wrong shape and size. To overcome this issue, I was inspired to create a vector drawable of Nepal's flag that would ensure its integrity and quality while maintaining its original dimensions.

## Size and Dimension
The size and dimensions of Nepal's flag, along with the step-by-step procedure for drawing it, are outlined in Schedule-1 of Nepal's Constitution of 2015. I have included this information below.
